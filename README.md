This is just my sample code i used rf-detr model to train and use it 

the code has following args oassed through it --model for model path, --input for input path and --output for output path

The dataset used was of RDD2022 data for road crack, potholes and other detections more over it was more augmented with other type of dataset for more type of detections like rutting road pothole and damaged sign

Moreover this code was used in a CPU based env if u want more power be sure to use it in GPU
